# Problem 3: Create a function that takes a list and finds the integer which appears an odd number of times.

# WHILE LOOP -> while loops are used when you don't know when the iteration should stop. For example if there are millions of data points and we need to find a data point that meets a certain condition. aka "indefinate iterations"


n = 5
while n > 0:
	n -= 1
	print(n)
'''
while n > 0 is header
n -= 1 is expression or body 

as long as or while n > 0, the loop will repeat the body n -= 1 and print one at a time 4,3,2,1
'''

n = 0 
while n > 0:
	n -= 1
	print(n)
# here it stops since the loop did not find any condition 

a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']

	print(a.pop())

# Problem 6

# number to find the factorial of

Solution: While Loops Practice
Solution: Factorials with While Loops
Here is our solution for this one:


# number to find the factorial of
number = 6
# start with our product equal to one
product = 1
# track the current number being multiplied
current = 1

while  current <= number:
    # multiply the product so far by the current number
    product *= current
    # increment current with each iteration until it reaches number
    current += 1


# print the factorial of number
print(product)


def factoriall(num):
	result = 1
	for i in range(1, num+1, 1):
		result *= i
		print(result)
factoriall(6)


num_list = [422, 136, 524, 85, 96, 719, 85, 92, 10, 17, 312, 542, 87, 23, 86, 191, 116, 35, 173, 45, 149, 59, 84, 69, 113, 166]

result = 0

for i in num_list:
    if i % 2 != 0:
        result += i
        print(result)
